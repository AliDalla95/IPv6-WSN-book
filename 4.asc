== IPv6 communication in Contiki and IoT/M2M protocols

The aim of this section is to introduce the reader to the most used protocols in IoT, already present in Contiki,
most from a M2M background, now making its way to most common IoT applications and services.

This section goes as follow:

* Revisiting the Z1 Websense application on Z1 Motes.

* UDP communication between network and host.

* CoAP example and Firefox Copper plugin.

* RESTfull HTTP example with curl.

* MQTT example.


== Revisiting the Z1 Websense application on Z1 Motes.

We expect your machine to have an IPv6 address, either via the existing cabled network or via a tunnel (such as Gogo6 or Hurricane Electric or others).

In the past examples we have deployed and analyzed link-local networks only, now we will take a step further and connect our networks to external ones, allowing them to be reachable from outside and communicate globally to other networks using 6loWPAN and IPv6.

This small example will allow to add a working webserver to your IPv6 network in Contiki, this serves as a starting point to implement more complete applications based on the webserver functionalities.

As we did in previously, we will be working with the `examples/z1/ipv6/z1-websense` application.  The sensors enabled for this test are temperature and battery.

To compile and program a mote just execute:

[source, perl]
----
make z1-websense.upload
----

When the script finish uploading the image to the mote, verify the application is running properly and check the IPv6 address:

[source, perl]
----
make z1-reset && make login
using saved target 'z1'
make -k -j 20 z1-reset-sequence
using saved target 'z1'
connecting to /dev/ttyUSB0 (115200) [OK]
Rime started with address 193.12.0.0.0.0.0.123
MAC c1:0c:00:00:00:00:00:7b Contiki-2.5-1646-g5c5678e started. Node id is set to 123.
CSMA ContikiMAC, channel check rate 8 Hz, radio channel 26
Tentative link-local IPv6 address fe80:0000:0000:0000:c30c:0000:0000:007b
Starting 'Sense Web Demo'
----

Then go to the border-router (see in section above how to access the border router via web browser) and verify the webserver is in the network:

[source, perl]
----
Neighbors
fe80::c30c:0:0:7b

Routes
aaaa::c30c:0:0:7b/128 (via fe80::c30c:0:0:7b)
----

We should be able to ping both the Border Router and the devices in the network.

Consult the webserver by browsing in your web browser http://[aaaa::c30c:0:0:7b] and see the available readings.

== UDP communication between network and host.

We can send UDP data

== CoAP example and Firefox Copper plug-in.

.What is CoAP?
****
Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a software protocol intended to be used in very simple electronics devices that allows them to communicate interactively over the Internet. It is particularly targeted for small low power sensors, switches, valves and similar components that need to be controlled or supervised remotely, through standard Internet networks. CoAP is an application layer protocol that is intended for use in resource-constrained internet devices, such as WSN nodes. CoAP is designed to easily translate to HTTP for simplified integration with the web, while also meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity.

Multicast, low overhead, and simplicity are extremely important for Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) devices, which tend to be deeply embedded and have much less memory and power supply than traditional internet devices have. Therefore, efficiency is very important. CoAP can run on most devices that support UDP. CoAP makes use of two message types, requests and responses, using a simple binary base header format. The base header may be followed by options in an optimized Type-Length-Value format. CoAP is by default bound to UDP and optionally to DTLS, providing a high level of communications security.

Any bytes after the headers in the packet are considered the message body if any. The length of the message body is implied by the datagram length. When bound to UDP the entire message MUST fit within a single datagram. When used with 6LoWPAN as defined in RFC 4944, messages should fit into a single IEEE 802.15.4 frame to minimize fragmentation.
****

First get the Copper (Cu) CoAP user-agent from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copper-270430/

image::./images/4/image00.png[]

Copper is a generic browser for the Internet of Things based on the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), a user-friendly management tool for networked embedded devices. As it is integrated to Web browsers, allows an intuitive interaction and a presentation layer making easier to debug and interact with existing CoAP devices.

=== Preparing the setup

For this practice we will use 3 motes: a BR, server and client.

Ensure the 3 motes you will be using to test this (border router, client, server) have flashed a Node ID to generate the MAC/IPv6 addresses as done in previous sessions, be sure to write down the addresses!

Another thing, if you get an error like the following, go to platform/z1/contiki-conf.h and change `UIP_CONF_BUFFER_SIZE` to 240:

[source, perl]
----
#error "UIP_CONF_BUFFER_SIZE too small for REST_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE"
make: *** [obj_z1/er-coap-07-engine.o] Error 1
----

*Server:*

[source, perl]
----
cd /examples/er-rest-example/
make er-example-server.upload && make z1-reset && make login
----

Annotate the IPv6 server address, disconnect the mote and connect another one to be used as client...

*Client:*

Remember you annotate the server address? edit the er-example-client.c and replace in this line:

[source, perl]
----
SERVER_NODE(ipaddr)   uip_ip6addr(ipaddr, 0xaaaa, 0, 0, 0, 0xc30c, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x039c)
----

Then compile and flash the client:
[source, perl]
----
make er-example-client.upload
----

Disconnect the mote, connect another one to be used as border-router...

*Border-Router:*

[source, perl]
----
cd ../ipv6/rpl-border-router/
make TARGET=z1 savetarget
make border-router.upload && make connect-router
----

Don't close this window! leave the mote connected, now you will be watching something like this:

[source, perl]

Let's ping the border-router:

[source, perl]
----
ping6 aaaa:0000:0000:0000:c30c:0000:0000:03e5
PING aaaa:0000:0000:0000:c30c:0000:0000:03e5(aaaa::c30c:0:0:3e5) 56 data bytes

64 bytes from aaaa::c30c:0:0:3e5: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=20.7 ms
----

Now connect the server mote, ping it too:

[source, perl]
----
ping6 aaaa:0000:0000:0000:c30c:0000:0000:039c
PING aaaa:0000:0000:0000:c30c:0000:0000:039c(aaaa::c30c:0:0:39c) 56 data bytes

64 bytes from aaaa::c30c:0:0:39c: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=35.7 ms
----

And connect the client mote, assuming it is connected in /dev/ttyUSB2 port:

[source, perl]
----
make login MOTES=/dev/ttyUSB2
../../tools/sky/serialdump-linux -b115200 /dev/ttyUSB2
connecting to /dev/ttyUSB2 (115200) [OK]

----

Now we can start discovering the resources, Open Firefox and type the server address:

[source, perl]
----
coap://[aaaa::c30c:0000:0000:039c]:5683/
----

And began by discovering the available resources, Press `DISCOVER` and the page will be populated in the left side:

If you select the `toggle` resource and use `POST` you can see how the RED led of the server mote will toggle:

If you do the same with the `Hello` resource, the server will answer you back with a neighbourly well-known message:

And finally if you observe the `Sensors`-> `Button` events by selecting it and clicking `OBSERVE`, each time you press the user button an event will be triggered and reported back:

Finally if you go to the er-example-server.c file and enable the following defines, you should have more resources available:

[source, perl]
----
#define REST_RES_HELLO    1
#define REST_RES_SEPARATE 1
#define REST_RES_PUSHING  1
#define REST_RES_EVENT    1
#define REST_RES_SUB      1
#define REST_RES_LEDS     1
#define REST_RES_TOGGLE   1
#define REST_RES_BATTERY  1
#define REST_RES_RADIO    1
----

And now to get the current RSSI level on the CC2420 transceiver:

[source, perl]
----
coap://[aaaa::c30c:0000:0000:0098]:5683/sensor/radio?p=rssi
----

Do the same to get the battery readings:
[source, perl]
----
coap://[aaaa::c30c:0000:0000:0098]:5683/sensors/battery
----

This last case returns the ADC units when the mote is connected to the USB, the actual mv value would be:

V [mV] = (units * 5000)/4096

Let's say you want to turn the green LED ON, in the URL type:

[source, perl]
----
coap://[aaaa::c30c:0000:0000:0098]:5683/actuators/leds?color=g
----

And then in the payload (the ongoing tab) write:

[source, perl]
----
mode="on"
----

And press POST or PUT (hover with the mouse over the actuators/leds to see the description and allowed methods).


== RESTfull HTTP example with curl.

.What is REST?
****
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. (It is sometimes spelled "ReST".) It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol - and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used.

REST and the Internet of Things (and Services) can be an excellent match. REST implementations are lightweight: HTTP clients and servers are now available even on the smallest, IP-enabled platforms.

The key abstraction of a RESTful web service is the resource, not a service. Sensors, actors and control systems in general can be elegantly represented as resources and their service exposed through a RESTful web service.

RESTful applications use HTTP requests to post data (create and/or update), read data (e.g., make queries), and delete data. Thus, REST uses HTTP for all four CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations.

Despite being simple, REST is fully-featured; there's basically nothing you can do in Web Services that can't be done with a RESTful architecture. REST is not a standard.

Install curl

[source, perl]
----
sudo apt-get install curl
----

In `/examples/rest-example/Makefile` switch to a HTTP build by disabling CoAP as follow `WITH_COAP = 0`.

Ensure the 2 motes you will be using to test this (Border Router, HTTP server) have flashed a MAC/IPv6 address, be sure to write down the addresses!
If you get an error like the following, Go to `platform/z1/contiki-conf.h` and change `UIP_CONF_BUFFER_SIZE` to 240, or just add this to a `project-conf.h file`.

[source, perl]
----
