== Introduction to IPv6

IPv6 stands for Internet Protocol version 6, so the importance of IPv6 is implicit in its name, it’s as important as Internet!
The Internet Protocol (IP from now on) was intended as a solution to the need to interconnect different data networks, and has become the “de facto” standard for all kinds of digital communications. Nowadays  IP is present in all devices that are able to send and receive digital information, not only the Internet.

IP is standardized by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), the organization in charge of all the Internet standards, guaranteeing the interoperability among different vendor’s software. The fact that IP is a standard is of vital importance, because today everything is getting connected to the Internet where IP is used. All available Operating Systems and networking libraries have IP available to send and receive data.
Included in this "everything-connected-to-Internet" is the IoT, so now you know why you are reading this chapter about IPv6, the last version of the Internet Protocol. In other words, today, the easiest way to send and receive data is using the standards used in the Internet, including the IP .

The objectives of this chapter are:

* Briefly describe the history of the Internet Protocol.

* Find out what IPv6 is used for.

* Get the IPv6 related concepts needed to understand the rest of the book.

* Provide a practical overview of IPv6, including addresses and a glimpse of how an IPv6 network looks like.

=== A little bit of History

ARPAnet was the first attempt of the US Department of Defense (DoD) to devise a decentralized network that was more resilient to an attack, while able to interconnect completely different systems. ARPAnet was created in the seventies, but it was in 1983 when a new brand protocol stack was introduced, the TCP/IP. The first widely used network protocol for this purpose was called IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) which gave rise to the civilian Internet. Initially only research centers and Universities were connected, supported by the NSF (National Science Foundation), and commercial applications where not allowed, but when the network started growing exponentially the NSF decided to transfer its operation and funding to private operators, and restrictions to commercial traffic where lifted. While the main applications where email and file transfers, it was with the development of the World Wide Web HTML and specifically with the MOSAIC graphic interface browser and its succesors that the traffic really exploded and the Internet began to be used by the masses. As a consequence there was a rapid depletion in the number of IP addresses available under IPv4, which was never designed to scale to these levels.

In order to have more addresses, you need more bits, which means a longer IP address, which means a new architecture, which means changes to all of the routing and network software.
After examining a number of proposals, the IETF settled on IPv6, recommended in January 1995 in RFC 1752, sometimes also referred to as the Next Generation Internet Protocol, or IPng. The IETF updated the IPv6 standard in 1998 with the current definition included in RFC 2460.
By 2004, IPv6 was widely available from industry and supported by most new network equipment. Today IPv6 coexist with IPv4 in the Internet and the amount of IPv6 traffic is quickly growing as more and more ISPs and content providers have started to make IPv6 available.

As you can see, the history of IP and Internet are almost the same, and because of this the growth of Internet is been hampered by the limitations of IPv4, and has led to the development of a new version of IP, IPv6, as the protocol to be used to interconnect all sorts of devices to send and/or receive information. There are even some technologies that are being developed only with IPv6 in mind, a good example in the context of the IoT is 6LowPAN.

From now on we will only center on IPv6. If you know something about IPv4, then you have half the way done, if not, don’t worry we will cover the main concepts briefly and gently.

=== IPv6 Concepts

We will cover the basics of IPv6, the minimum you need to know about the last version of the Internet Protocol to understand why it's so useful for the IoT and how it's related with other protocols like 6LowPAN covered later in this book.
It would be useful to have the basic networking concepts, and be familiar with bits, bytes, networking stack, network layer, packets, IP header, etc. In any case, things will be explained from scratch to allow everybody to understand IPv6 and its features. You should understand that IPv6 is a different protocol, non-compatible with IPv4.

In the following figure we represent the layered model used in the Internet.

.Internet Protocol stack
image::./images/1/image001.png[align="center"]

IPv6 operates in layer 3, also called network layer. The pieces of data handled by layer 3 are called packets. Devices connected to the Internet can be hosts or routers. A host can be a PC, a laptop or a sensor board, sending and/or receiving data packets. Hosts will be the source or destination of the packets. Routers instead are in charge of packet forwarding, and are responsible of choosing the next router that will forward them towards the final destination. Internet is composed of a lot of interconnected routers, which receive data packets in one interface and send then as quick as possible using another interface towards another forwarding router.

==== IPv6 packet

The first thing you have to know is what an IPv6 packet looks like. In the layered model we saw before, each layer introduces its own information in the packet, and this information is intended for, and can only be processed by the same layer in other IP device. This "conversation" between layers at the same level on different devices is known as a protocol.

The layer defined are:

* **Application**: Here resides the software developed by programmers, that will use network services offered by the network stack. An example is the web browser that opens a network connection towards a web server. Another example is the web server software that runs in a server somewhere in the Internet waiting to answer request from client's browsers. Examples of application protocols are HTTP or DNS.

* **Transport**: Is a layer above the network layer that offers services beyond the basic ones offered by the network layer, for example, retransmit lost packets or guarantee the ordered delivery of the packets, in the same order they have been sent. This layer will be the one that shows a "network service" to the application layer, a service they can use to send or receive data. Two are the most used transport protocols used in Internet, TCP and UDP.

* **Network**: This is the layer in charge of the correct delivery of the data received from the transport layer to its destination, as well as the reception of the received data from the link layer in the data destination. In Internet there is only one network protocol, the IP. Source and destination are identified by means of the IP addresses.

* **Link**: Link layer is in charge of sending and receiving frames, a collection of bytes sent/received from the network layer, in the scope of a local area network or LAN. This layer has its own addresses that will change depending on the technology used.

* **Physical**: This layer is in charge of all the electromagnetic signals, codifications, etc. needed for the digital information to go from one node to the next one. All physical media are included, both wired and wireless.

The following figure illustrates the idea that each of the above layers receive some bytes and add some specific information for that layer to be processed in other host. In the figure data is being send, starting in the application layer and being sent to another node in the physical layer.

.Data flow in the protocol stack
image::./images/1/image009.png[align="center"]

If we focus on the network layer, specifically in IPv6, the bytes sent and received in the IP packet have an standardized format. The following figure shows the basic IPv6 header:

.IPv6 Header
image::./images/1/image002.png[align="center"]

First you have the *basic IPv6 header* with a fixed size of 40 bytes, followed by upper layer data and optionally by some extension headers, that will be covered later. As you can see there are several fields in the packet header, with some improvements as compared with IPv4 header:

* The number of fields have been reduced from 12 to 8.

* The basic IPv6 header has a fixed size of 40 bytes and is aligned with 64 bits, allowing a faster hardware-based packet forwarding on routers.

* The size of addresses increased from 32 to 128 bits.

The most important fields are the source and destination addresses. As you already know, every IP device has a unique IP address that identifies it in the Internet. This IP address is used by routers to take their forwarding decisions.

IPv6 header has 128 bits for each IPv6 address, this allows for 2^128^ addresses (approximately 3.4×10^38^,i.e., 3.4 followed by 38 zeroes), compared with IPv4 that have 32 bits to encode the IPv4 address allowing for 2^32^ addresses (4,294,967,296).

We have seen the basic IPv6 header, and mentioned the *extension headers*. To keep the basic header simple and of a fixed size, additional features are added to IPv6 by means of extension headers.

.IPv6 Extension headers
image::./images/1/image003.png[align="center"]

Several extension headers have been defined, as you can see in the previous figure, and they have to follow the order shown. Extensions headers:

* Provide flexibility, for example, to enable security by ciphering the data in the packet.

* Optimize the processing of the packet, because with the exception of the hop by hop header, extensions are processed only by end nodes, (source and final destination of the packet), not by every router in the path.

* They are located as a "chain of headers" starting always in the basic IPv6 header, that use the field next header to point to the following extension header.

==== IPv6 addressing

As can be seen in the basic IPv6 header figure, both the source address and destination address fields have 128 bits to codify an IPv6 address. The use of 128 bits for addresses brings some benefits:

* Provide much more addresses, to satisfy current and future needs, with ample space for innovation.

* Easy address auto-configuration mechanisms.

* Easier address management/delegation.

* Room for more levels of hierarchy and for route aggregation.

* Ability to do end-to-end IPsec.

IPv6 addresses are classified into the following categories (these categories also exist for IPv4):

* *Unicast* (one-to-one): used to send a packet from one source to one destination. Are the commonest ones and we will talk more about them and the sub-classes that exist.
* *Multicast* (one-to-many): used to send a packet from one source to several destinations. This is possible by means of multicast routing that enable packets to replicate in some places.
* *Anycast* (one-to-nearest): used to send a packet from one source the nearest destination from a set of them.
* *Reserved*: Addresses or groups of them that have special uses defined, for example addresses to be used on documentation and examples.

Before entering into more detail about IPv6 addresses and the types of unicast addresses, let's see how do they look like and what are the notation rules. You need to have them clear because probably the first problem you will find in practice when using IPv6 is how to write an address.

.IPv6 address
image::./images/1/image010.png[align="center"]

*IPv6 addresses notation rules* are:

* 8 Groups of 16 bits separated by “:”.

* Hexadecimal notation of each nibble (4 bits).

* Non case sensitive.

* Network Prefixes (group of addresses) are written Prefix / Prefix Length, i.e., prefix length indicate the number of bits of the address that are fixed.

* Leftmost zeroes within each group can be eliminated.

* One or more all-zero-groups can be substituted by “::”. This can be done only once.

The first three  rules tell you the basis of IPv6 address notation. They use hexadecimal notation, i.e., numbers are represented by sixteen symbols between 0 and F. You will have eight groups of four hexadecimal symbols, each group separated by a colon ":".
The last two rules are for address notation compression, we will see how this works with some examples.

Let's see some examples:

1) If we represent all the address bits we have the preferred form, for example: `2001:0db8:4004:0010:0000:0000:6543:0ffd`

2) If we use squared brackets around the address we have the literal form of the address: `[2001:0db8:4004:0010:0000:0000:6543:0ffd]`

3) If we apply the fourth rule, allowing compression within each group by eliminating leftmost zeroes, we have: `2001:db8:4004:10:0:0:6543:ffd`

4) If we apply the fifth rule, allowing compression of one or more consecutive groups of zeroes using "::", we have: `2001:db8:4004:10::6543:ffd`

Care should be taken when compressing and decompressing IPv6 addresses. The process should be reversible. It's very common to have some mistakes. For example, the following address `2001:db8:A:0:0:12:0:80` could be compressed even more using "::". we have two options:

a) `2001:db8:A::12:0:80`
b) `2001:db8:A:0:0:12::80`

Both are correct IPv6 addresses. The following address `2001:db8:A::12::80` is wrong, as it does not follow the last compression rule we saw above. The problem with this badly compressed address is that we can't be sure how to expand it, its ambiguous. We can't know if it expands to `2001:db8:A:0:12:0:0:80` or to `2001:db8:A:0:0:12:0:80`.

==== IPv6 network prefix

Last but not least you have to understand the concept of a *network prefix*, that indicates some fixed bits and some non-defined bits that could be used to create new sub-prefixes or to define complete IPv6 addresses assigned to hosts.

Let's see some examples:

1) The network prefix `2001:db8:1::/48` (the compressed form of `2001:0db8:0001:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000`) indicates that the first 48 bits will always be the same (`2001:0db8:0001`) but that we can play with the other 80 bits, for example, to obtain two smaller prefixes: `2001:db8:1:a::/64` and `2001:db8:1:b::/64`.

2) If we take one of the smaller prefixes defined above, `2001:db8:1:b::/64`, where the first 64 bits are fixed we have the rightmost 64 bits to assign, for example, to an IPv6 interface in a host: `2001:db8:1:b:1:2:3:4`.
This last example allow us to introduce a basic concept in IPv6: *In a LAN (Local Area Network) a /64 prefix is always used*. *The rightmost 64 bits, are called the interface identifier (IID) because they uniquely identify a host's interface in the local network defined by the /64 prefix*. The following figure illustrates this statement:

.Network and Interface ID
image::./images/1/image004.png[align="center"]

Now that you have seen your first IPv6 addresses we can enter into more detail about two types of addresses you will find when you start working with IPv6: reserved and unicast.

The following are some reserved or special purpose addresses:

* The *unspecified address*, used as a placeholder when no address is available: `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0` (::/128)

* The *loopback address*, for an interface sending packets to itself: `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1` (::1/128)

* *Documentation Prefix*: `2001:db8::/32`. This prefix is reserved to be used in examples and documentation, you have already seen it in this chapter.

As specified in [RFC6890] there is a registry maintained by IANA about special purpose IPv6 addresses [IANA-IPV6-SPEC].

The following are some types of unicast addresses [RFC4291]:

* *Link-local*: Link-local addresses are always configured in any IPv6 interface that is connected to a network. They all start with the prefix `FE80::/10` and can be used to communicate with other hosts on the same local network, i.e., all hosts connected to the same switch. They cannot be used to communicate with other networks, i.e., to send or receive packets through a router.

* *ULA* (Unique Local Address) [RFC4193]: All ULA addresses start with the prefix FC00::/7, what means in practice that you could see `FC00::/8` or `FD00::/8`. Intended for local communications, usually inside a single site, they are not expected to be routable on the Global Internet but routable inside a more limited network managed by the same organization.

* *Global Unicast*: Equivalent to the IPv4 public addresses,they are unique in the whole Internet and could be used to send a packet from anywhere in the Internet to any other destination in Internet.

=== What is IPv6 used for?

As we have seen IPv6 has some features that facilitates things like global addressing and hosts address autoconfiguration.
Because IPv6 provides as much addresses as we may need for some hundred of years, we can put a global unicast IPv6 address on almost anything we may think of. This brings back the initial Internet paradigm that every IP device could communicate with every IP device. This end-to-end communication allow for bidirectional communication all over the Internet and between any IP device, which could result in collaborative applications and new ways of storing, sending and accessing the information.

In the context of this book we can, for example, think on IPv6 sensors all around the world collecting, sending and being accessed from different places to create a world-wide mesh of physical values measured, stored and processed.

The availability of a huge amount of addresses has allowed a new mechanism called *stateless address autoconfiguration* (SLAAC) that didn't exist with IPv4. Following is a brief summary of the ways you can configure an address on an IPv6 interface:

* *Statically*: You can decide which address you will give to your IP device and then manually configure it into the device using any kind of interface: web, command line, etc. Commonly you also have to configure other network parameters like the gateway to use to send packets out of your network.

* *DHCPv6* (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6) [RFC3315]: A similar mechanism already existed for IPv4 and the idea is the same. You need to configure a dedicated server that after a brief negotiation with the IP device assigns an IP address to it. DHCPv6 allows IP devices to be configured automatically, this is why it is named stateful address autoconfiguration, because the DHCPv6 server maintains a state of assigned addresses.

* *SLAAC*: Stateless address autoconfiguration [RFC4862] is a new mechanism introduced with IPv6 that allows to configure automatically all network parameters on an IP device using the router that gives connectivity to a network.

The advantage of SLAAC is that it simplifies the configuration of "dumb" devices, like sensors, cameras or any other device with low processing power. You don't need to use any interface in the IP device to configure anything, just "plug and net". It also simplifies the network infrastructure needed to build a basic IPv6 network, because you don't need additional device/server, you use the same router you need to send packets outside your network to configure the IP devices.
We are not going to enter into details, but you just need to know that in a local network, usually called a LAN (Local Area Network), that is connected to a router, this router is in charge of sending all the information needed to its hosts using an RA (Router Advertisement) message. The router will send RAs periodically, but in order to expedite the process, a host can send an RS (Router Solicitation) message when its interface gets connected to the network. The router will send an RA immediately in response to the RS.

The following figure show the packet exchange between a host that has just connected to a local network and some IPv6 destination in the Internet:

.Packet exchange in IPv6
image::./images/1/image005.png[align="center"]


1) R1 is the router that gives connectivity to the host in the LAN and is periodically sending RAs .

2) Both R1 and Host have a link-local address in their interfaces connected to the host's LAN, this address is configured automatically when the interface is ready. Our host creates it's link-local address by combining the 64 leftmost bits of the link-local's prefix (`fe80::/64`) and the 64 rightmost bits of a locally generated IID (`:3432:7ff1:c001:c2a1`). These link-local addresses can be used in the LAN to exchange packets, but not to send packets outside the LAN.

3) The hosts needs two basic things to be able to send packets to other networks: a global IPv6 address and the address of a gateway, i.e., a router to which send the packets it wants to get routed outside its network.

4) Although R1 is sending RAs periodically (usually every several seconds) when the host get connected and has configured its link-local address, it sends an RS to which R1 responds immediately with an RA containing two things

1. A *global prefix of length 64 bits* that is intended for SLAAC. The host takes the received prefix and add to it a locally generated IID, usually the same as the one used for link-local address. This way a global IPv6 address is configured in the host and now can communicate with the IPv6 Internet

2. Implicitly included is the **link-local address of R1**, because it is the source address of the RA. Our host can use this address to configure the **default gateway**, the place to which send the packets by default, to reach an IPv6 host somewhere in Internet.

5) Once both the gateway and global IPv6 address are configured, the host can receive or send information. In the figure it has something to send (Tx Data) to a host in Internet, so it creates an IPv6 packet with the destination address of the recipient host and as source address the just autoconfigured global address, which is sent to its gateway, R1's link-local address. The destination host can answer with some data (Rx Data).

=== Network Example

Following we show how a simple IPv6 network looks like, displaying IPv6 addresses for all the networking devices.

.Simple IPv6 network
image::./images/1/image006.png[align="center"]

We have four hosts,  (sensors, or other devices), and we want to put two of them in two different places, for example two floors in a building. We are dealing with four IP devices but you can have up to 2^64^ (18,446,744,073,709,551,616) devices connected on the same LAN.

We create two LANs with a router on each one, both routers connected to a central router (R1) that provides connectivity to Internet. LAN1 is served by R2 (with link-local address `fe80::2c:f3f4:1214:a` on that LAN) and uses the prefix `2001:db8:1:2::/64` announced by SLAAC. LAN2 is served by R3 (with link-local address `fe80::1b:fff4:3344:b` on that LAN) and uses the prefix `2001:db8:1:3::/64` announced by SLAAC.

All hosts have both a link-local IPv6 address and a global IPv6 address autoconfigured using the announced prefix by the corresponding router by means of RAs. In addition, remember that each host also configure the gateway using the link-local address used by the router for the RA. Link-local address can be used for communication among hosts inside a LAN, but for communicating with hosts in other LANs or any other network outside its own LAN a global IPv6 address is needed.

=== Short intro to Wireshark

.What is Wireshark?
****
.Wireshark logo
image::./images/1/image007.png[align="center"]

**Wireshark** is a free and open-source packet analyzer, allows packet traces to be sniffed, captured, and analysed.

A packet trace is a record of traffic at some location on the network, as if a snapshot was taken of all the bits that passed across a particular wire. The packet trace records a timestamp for each packet, along with the bits that make up the packet, from the low-layer headers to the higher-layer contents.

Wireshark runs on most operating systems, including Windows, MAC and Linux. It provides a graphical user interface that shows the sequence of packets and the meaning of the bits when interpreted as protocol headers and data. The packets are color-coded to convey their meaning, and Wireshark includes various ways to filter and analyze them to let you investigate different aspects of behavior. It is widely used to troubleshoot networks.

A common usage scenario is when a person wants to troubleshoot network problems or look at the internal workings of a network protocol. A user could, for example, see exactly what happens when he or she opens up a website or set up a wireless sensor network.  It is also possible to filter and search on given packet attributes, which facilitates the debugging process.

More information and installation instructions are available at https://www.wireshark.org/[Wireshark site].

.Wireshark Screenshot

When you open Wireshark, there are four main areas, from top to bottom: menus and filters, list of captured packets, detailed information about the selected packet, full content of the selected packet in hexadecimal and ASCII. Online directly links you to Wiresharks site, a handy user guide, and information on the security of Wireshark. Under Files, you’ll find Open, which lets you open previously saved captures, and Sample Captures. You can download any of the sample captures through this website, and study the data. This will help you understand what kind of packets Wireshark can capture.

The Capture section let you choose your Interface. You can see each of the interfaces that are available. It’ll also show you which ones are active. Clicking details will show you some pretty generic information about that interface.

Under Start, you can choose one or more interfaces to check out. Capture Options allows you to customize what information you see during a capture. Take a look at your Capture Options – here you can choose a filter, a capture file, and more. Under Capture Help, you can read up on how to capture, and you can check info on Network Media about which interfaces work on which platforms.

Let’s select an interface and click Start. To stop a capture, press the red square in the top toolbar. If you want to start a new capture, hit the green triangle which looks like a shark fin next to it. Now that you have got a finished capture, you can click File, and save, open, or merge the capture. You can print it, you can quit the program, and you can export your packet capture in a variety of ways.

Under edit you can find a certain packet, with the search options you can copy packets, you can mark (highlight) any specific packet or all the packets. Another interesting thing you can do under Edit, is resetting the time value. You’ll notice that the time is in seconds incrementing. You can reset it from the packet you’ve clicked on. You can add a comment to a packet, configure profiles and preferences.

When we select a packet from the list of captured ones, Wireshark shows detailed information of the different protocols used by that packet, for example Ethernet:

.Ethernet packet
image::./images/1/image017.png[align="center"]

Or IPv6, where we can see the fields we saw before in the theory: Version, Traffic class, flowlabel, payload length, next header, etc.:

.IPv6 packet
image::./images/1/image018.png[align="center"]

There are two methods to apply filters to the list of captured packets:

* Write a filter expression on the specific box and then apply it. Protocols could be specified (ip,
ipv6, icmp, icmpv6), fields of a protocol (ipv6.dst, ipv6.src) and even complex expressions could be created using operators like AND (&&), OR (||) or the negation (|).

.Wireshark Filter
image::./images/1/image019.png[align="center"]

* Another option to create filters it to right click in one filed of a captured packet, in the list of captured packets. There will appear a menu option "Apply as filter", with several options on how to use that field.

.Wireshark Captured packets
image::./images/1/image020.png[align="center"]

Another useful and interesting option of Wireshark is the possibility to see statistics about the captured traffic. If we have applied filters, the statistics will be about the filtered traffic. Just go to Statistics menu and select, for example, Protocol Hierarchy:

.Wireshark statistics
image::./images/1/image021.png[align="center"]

Other interesting options are:

* Conversation List -> IPv6

* Statistics -> Endpoint List -> IPv6

* Statistics -> IO Graph

This last option allow to create graphs with different lines for different types of traffic and save the image:

You have the following network:

.LAN Example
image::./images/1/image008.png[align="center"]

You have to define the following:

.. IPv6 prefix for LAN1, a /64 prefix taken from the /56 you have.
.. IPv6 prefix for LAN2, a /64 prefix taken from the /56 you have.
.. IPv6 prefix for LAN3, a /64 prefix taken from the /56 you have.
.. A global IPv6 address using the LAN1 prefix for H1 host (added to the link-local address already used).
.. A global IPv6 address using the LAN2 prefix for H2 host (added to the link-local address already used).
.. A global IPv6 address using the LAN3 prefix for H3 host (added to the link-local address already used).

TIP: Hint: To divide the /56 prefix into /64 prefixes, you have to change the value of the bits 57 to 64, i.e., the XY values in `2001:db8:A:01XY::/64`.

=== Connecting our IPv6 Network to the Internet

As have been said in the introduction of this book, network communications is one of the four basic elements of an IoT system. We already have seen that IPv6 brings the possibility of giving an IP address to almost anything we can think of, and can do this making it easy to autoconfoigure network parameters on our devices.

Once we have all our "things" connected using IPv6, they can use it to communicate between them locally or with any other "thing" on the IPv6 Internet. In this chapter we will *focus on the Internet side of the communication of the "things"* composing the Internet of Things.

As we will see in this book, having the possibility to connect our devices to the Internet brings new possibilities and services. For example, if we could connect our wireless sensors networks to a centralized repository, where all the sensed information could be processed together and stores for historical records, this will allow to know better what has happened and maybe foresee future events. This basic idea is what nowadays is called "The Big Data" and has a whole set of it own concepts and techniques.

.IPv6 Connectivity

Getting back to our network connectivity domain, our objective is to connect our IoT devices to the Internet using IPv6, allowing for communication with other IoT devices, collecting servers or even with people.

Related with the IPv6 connectivity to Internet is an important idea: **communication between IoT devices and the IPv6 Internet could be bidirectional**. This is important to remark because with IPv4, connectivity is usually designed as a one direction channel between a client and a server. This changes with IPv6.

Having a bidirectional communication with the IoT devices, will bring useful possibilities, because its not just that the device can send information to somewhere in the Internet, but that anybody in the Internet would be able to send information, requests or orders to the IoT device. This can be used in different scenarios:

* **Management**: To manage the IoT device performing some status tests, updating some parameters/configuration/firmware remotely allowing for a better and efficient use of the hardware platform and improving the infrastructure security.

* **Control**: Send commands or to control actuators that make the IoT device to perform an action.

* **Communication**: Send information to the IoT device, that can use it to be shown using some kind of interface.

IPv6 is still being deployed all over the different networks that compose the Internet, what means that different scenarios can be found when creating our IoT devices network and trying to connect it to the IPv6 Internet. Following are the three most possible scenarios, ordered by preference. This means that the objective, from the IPv6 connectivity point of view, is the first one: Native IPv6 connectivity.

* **Native IPv6 Connectivity**: This scenario is based on the support of IPv6 of both the ISP providing connectivity to the Internet and the router(s) and networks devices used in our network. Native IPv6 means that the IPv6 packets will flow without being changed or tunnelled all over its path from origin to destination. It's common to find what is called dual-stack networks, where both native IPv6 and native IPv4 is being used at the same time in the same interfaces and devices. This native IPv6 scenario covers both cases: IPv6-only or dual-stack.

As could be seen in the figure, our IoT devices cloud is connected to a router (R2) that provides them a prefix creating a LAN (LAN2). The router that provides connectivity to the IPv6 Internet (R1) will be in charge of autoconfiguring IPv6 devices in LAN1, for example R2, sending RAs (Router Advertisements) as seen when SLAAC was explained.

* **No IPv6 connectivity**: In this scenario we face a common problem nowadays, the lack of IPv6 connectivity from an ISP. Although we have IPv6 support on the router that connects our network to Internet the ISP does not provide IPv6 connectivity, only IPv4. The solution is to use one of the so called IPv6 Transition Mechanism. The most simple and useful in this case would be the 6in4 tunnel, based on creating a point-to-point static tunnel that encapsulates IPv6 packets into IPv4.

The figure shows the solution using a 6in4 tunnel, created from R1 to a tunnel end point, that will be a router having connectivity to both the IPv4 and IPv6 Internet. The native IPv6 traffic from our networks (LAN1 and LAN2) will reach R1, that will take the whole IPv6 packet with it's data, and put it inside a new IPv4 packet with destination IPv4 address the one of the Tunnel End router. The Tunnel End router will take off the IPv6 packet and put it as native IPv6 traffic into the IPv6 Internet. The same encapsulation occurs when IPv6 traffic is sent from the IPv6 Internet to our networks.

* **No IPv6 connectivity and no IPv6 capable router**: This scenario covers the case where there is no IPv6 connectivity from the ISP, nor IPv6 support on the router connecting our network to the Internet. As seen before, to solve the lack of IPv6 connectivity from the ISP we can use a 6in4 tunnel, but in this scenario we also have to solve the lack of IPv6 support on the router that won't be able to create the tunnel. The solution is to add a new router that supports IPv6, and IPv4, and create a 6in4 tunnel from this router to a tunnel end router somewhere on the IPv4 Internet.

.Local router does not support IPv6

In this scenario a new router R3 is added to both create a 6in4 tunnel towards the Tunnel End router and serve as an IPv6 gateway to our networks, sending RAs to autoconfigure IPv6 devices in LAN1. The encapsulation/decapsulation process will work exactly the same as in the previous scenario. The main difference here is that 6in4 tunnels need a public IPv4 address, so R3 will need to have a public IPv4 address to be able to create the 6in4 tunnel. This is easy to get in routers connected to ISPs, but not so common inside our network where we can have private addresses and NAT.

The scenarios showed above are based on a good infrastructure, where we have at least two routers and a couple of LANs. All three scenarios could be simplified into a just one router scenario shown in the following figure:

.Simplified Scenario

Considerations about lack of IPv6 connectivity from the ISP and IPv6 support on the router are the same, although for the latter the solution is to change the only router by one that supports IPv6.

This is common because IoT or WSN could be deployed anywhere, including far away networks connected using any wireless technology that can reach remote places. In this scenarios there are severe restrictions on the number of devices, power consumption, etc. For example, a cloud of sensors could be deployed in the country to sense temperature and moisture, and all of them get connectivity through just one router connected using IPv6 mobile phone network (GPRS, 3G or LTE).
