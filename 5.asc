A table summarizing the features would be nice

==== CoAP example

.What is CoAP?
****
The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a software protocol intended to be used in very simple electronics devices that allows them to communicate interactively over the Internet. It is particularly targeted for small low power sensors, switches, valves and similar components that need to be controlled or supervised remotely, through standard Internet networks. CoAP is an application layer protocol that is intended for use in resource-constrained internet devices, such as WSN nodes. CoAP is designed to easily translate to HTTP for simplified integration with the web, while also meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity.

CoAP can run on most devices that support UDP. CoAP makes use of two message types, requests and responses, using a simple binary base header format. The base header may be followed by options in an optimized Type-Length-Value format. CoAP is by default bound to UDP and optionally to DTLS, providing a high level of communications security.

Any bytes after the headers in the packet are considered the message body (if any is present). The length of the message body is implied by the datagram length. When bound to UDP the entire message MUST fit within a single datagram. When used with 6LoWPAN as defined in RFC 4944, messages should fit into a single IEEE 802.15.4 frame to minimize fragmentation.

First get the Copper (Cu) CoAP user-agent from:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copper-270430/

Copper is a generic browser for the Internet of Things based on the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), a user-friendly management tool for networked embedded devices. As it is integrated into web browsers, it allows an intuitive interaction and with the presentation layer making easier to debug existing CoAP devices.

==== Preparing the setup

For this practice we will use 3 motes: BR, server and client.

Ensure that  the 3 motes you will be using to test this (border router, client, server) have flashed a Node ID to generate the MAC/IPv6 addresses as done in previous sessions, be sure to write down the addresses!

Another thing, if you get an error like the following, go to `platform/z1/contiki-conf.h` and change `UIP_CONF_BUFFER_SIZE` to 240:

[source, bash]
----
#error "UIP_CONF_BUFFER_SIZE too small for REST_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE"
make: *** [obj_z1/er-coap-07-engine.o] Error 1
----

Be sure the settings are consistent, at the `examples/ipv6/rpl-border-router` in the `project-conf.h` file add the following:

[source, c]
----
#undef NETSTACK_CONF_RDC
#define NETSTACK_CONF_RDC     nullrdc_driver

#undef NETSTACK_CONF_MAC
#define NETSTACK_CONF_MAC     nullmac_driver
----

*Server:*

[source, bash]
----
cd examples/er-rest-example/
make TARGET=z1 savetarget
make er-example-server.upload && make z1-reset && make login
----

Write down the IPv6 server address, disconnect the mote and connect another one to be used as client...

*Client:*

Remember the server address? edit the er-example-client.c and replace in this line:

[source, c]
----
SERVER_NODE(ipaddr)   uip_ip6addr(ipaddr, 0xaaaa, 0, 0, 0, 0xc30c, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x039c)
----

Then compile and flash the client:

[source, bash]
----
make er-example-client.upload
----

Disconnect the mote, connect another one to be used as border-router:

*Border-Router:*

[source, bash]
----
cd ../ipv6/rpl-border-router/
make TARGET=z1 savetarget
make border-router.upload && make connect-router
----

Don't close this window! leave the mote connected, now you will be watching something like this:

[source, bash]

----

Let's ping the border-router:

[source, c]
----
ping6 aaaa:0000:0000:0000:c30c:0000:0000:03e5
PING aaaa:0000:0000:0000:c30c:0000:0000:03e5(aaaa::c30c:0:0:3e5) 56 data bytes

64 bytes from aaaa::c30c:0:0:3e5: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=20.7 ms
----

Now connect the server mote, ping it too:

[source, c]
----
ping6 aaaa:0000:0000:0000:c30c:0000:0000:0001
PING aaaa:0000:0000:0000:c30c:0000:0000:0001(aaaa::c30c:0:0:1) 56 data bytes

64 bytes from aaaa::c30c:0:0:1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=35.7 ms
----

And connect the client mote, assuming it is connected in `/dev/ttyUSB2` port:

[source, c]
----
make login MOTES=/dev/ttyUSB2
../../tools/sky/serialdump-linux -b115200 /dev/ttyUSB2
connecting to /dev/ttyUSB2 (115200) [OK]

----

Now we can start discovering the Server resources, Open Firefox and type the server address:

[source, c]
----
coap://[aaaa::c30c:0000:0000:0001]:5683/
----

And began by discovering the available resources, Press `DISCOVER` and the page will be populated in the left side:

If you select the `toggle` resource and use `POST` you can see how the RED led of the server mote will toggle:

If you do the same with the `Hello` resource, the server will answer you back with a neighbourly well-known message:

And finally if you observe the `Sensors`-> `Button` events by selecting it and clicking `OBSERVE`, each time you press the user button an event will be triggered and reported back:

Finally if you go to the `er-example-server.c` file and enable the following defines, you should have more resources available:

[source, c]
----
#define REST_RES_HELLO    1
#define REST_RES_SEPARATE 1
#define REST_RES_PUSHING  1
#define REST_RES_EVENT    1
#define REST_RES_SUB      1
#define REST_RES_LEDS     1
#define REST_RES_TOGGLE   1
#define REST_RES_BATTERY  1
#define REST_RES_RADIO    1
----

And now to get the current RSSI level on the CC2420 transceiver:

[source, c]
----
coap://[aaaa::c30c:0000:0000:0001]:5683/sensor/radio?p=rssi
----

Do the same to get the battery level readings:
[source, c]
----
coap://[aaaa::c30c:0000:0000:0001]:5683/sensors/battery
----

This last case returns the ADC units when the mote is connected to the USB, the actual value in millivolts would be:
[source, c]
----
V [mV] = (units * 5000)/4096
----

Let's say you want to turn the green LED ON, in the URL type:

[source, c]
----
coap://[aaaa::c30c:0000:0000:0001]:5683/actuators/leds?color=g
----

And then in the payload (the ongoing tab) write:

[source, c]
----
mode="on"
----

And press `POST` or `PUT` (hover with the mouse over the actuators/leds to see the description and allowed methods).

==== RestFULL HTTP example

.What is REST?
****
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. (It is sometimes spelled "ReST".) It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol - and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used.

REST and the Internet of Things (and Services) can be an excellent match. REST implementations are lightweight: HTTP clients and servers are now available even on the smallest, IP-enabled platforms.

The key abstraction of a RESTful web service is the resource, not a service. Sensors, actuators and control systems in general can be elegantly represented as resources and their service exposed through a RESTful web service.

RESTful applications use HTTP requests to post data (create and/or update), read data (e.g., make queries), and delete data. Thus, REST uses HTTP for all four CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations.

Despite being simple, REST is fully-featured; there's basically nothing you can do in Web Services that can't be done with a RESTful architecture. REST is not a standard.

Install curl

In `/examples/rest-example/Makefile` switch to a HTTP build by disabling CoAP as follow `WITH_COAP = 0`.

Ensure that the two motes you will be using to test this (Border Router, HTTP server) have flashed a MAC/IPv6 address, be sure to write down the addresses!
If you get an error like the following, Go to `platform/z1/contiki-conf.h` and change `UIP_CONF_BUFFER_SIZE` to 240, or just add this to a `project-conf.h file`.
