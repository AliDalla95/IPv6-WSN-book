== Introduction

=== About the Book

The "IoT in five days" book is in active development by a joint effort from both academia and industrial collaborators, as they acknowledge the Internet of Things of the future to be built on top of scalable and mature protocols, such as IPv6, 6LoWPAN and IEEE 802.15.4.  Open Source Operating Systems as Contiki, with more than 10 years of history and actively supported by Universities and Research centers, has been paving the Internet of Things road since the early beginnings of Wireless Sensor Networks and M2M communication, to this new IoT paradigm.

The content of the book are Open Source as well, feedback and contribution is more than welcome!  The sources are maintained in the following repositories:

* https://github.com/marcozennaro/IPv6-WSN-book

The book has been developed in asciidoc, it can be further compiled from its sources to HTML, PDF, eBook and others.

=== About the Authors

*Antonio Liñán* defines himself as _"an engineer at day, maker at night"_ (he would do both for free).
He has more than 8 years and more than 20 projects of experience in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Internet of Things (IoT) applications and embedded firmware development; working in Zolertia as both senior R+D engineer and CTO, buf if you ask him he just _"make things blink and chat"_.  In his free time he's normally
engaged in Coursera, collecting hardware platforms, dwelling in hackathons or preaching about GIT.  He has a Master at the University of Los Andes (Colombia), it has worked in European Projects related to Smart Cities, Internet of Things and Security, and currently is a prominent contributor in severals Open Source communities, such as Contiki.

*Alvaro Vives* loves technology, problem solving, learning and teaching. Doing these things he has become a consultant, a network and systems engineer, and trainer. As a consultant, he has worked on projects in several countries, at ISPs, content providers, public organizations and enterprises. As a trainer since 2006 has given more than 46 workshops in 18 countries for ISPs, content providers, public organizations, enterprises and in events like LACNIC/LACNOG, SANOG, WALC, and ESNOG. As network and systems administrator he has been in charge of production networks and services in several companies using different technologies and vendors. At present, he is working with WSN and IoT as a consequence of the convergence of IPv6 and IoT.

*Antoine Bagula* obtained his doctoral degree in 2006 from the KTH-Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. Currently holds a lecturing positions at the University of Stellenbosch and the University of Cape Town before joining the Computer Science department at the University of the Western Cape in January 2014. Since 2006, He is a frequent consultant of the UNESCO through its International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste-Italy, the World Bank and other international organizations on different telecommunication projects. He is senior associate of the UNESCO International Centre for Theoretical Physics of Trieste/Italy and have been actively involved in the centre training programme on wireless networking. His research interest is Computer Networking with a specific focus on the Internet-of-Things, Cloud Computing, Network security and Network protocols for wireless and wired mesh networks and hybrid networks

*Marco Zennaro* received his M.Sc. Degree in Electronic Engineering from University of Trieste in Italy. He defended his PhD thesis on “Wireless Sensor Networks for Development: Potentials and Open Issues” at KTH-Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.
His research interest is in ICT4D, the use of ICT for Development. In particular, he is interested in Wireless Networks and in Wireless Sensor Networks in developing countries. He has been giving lectures on Wireless technologies in more than 20 countries.

When not traveling, he is the editor of the  http://wsnblog.com/[wsnblog.com].  He is coauthor of the book “Wireless Networking for the Developing World”.

*Ermanno Pietrosemoli* is currently a researcher at the Telecommunications/ICT for Development Lab of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, and President of Fundación Escuela Latinoamericana de Redes “EsLaRed”, a non-profit organization that promotes ICT in Latin America through training and development projects. EsLaRed was awarded the 2008 Jonathan B.Postel Service Award by the Internet Society.

Ermanno has been deploying wireless data communication networks focusing on low cost technology, and has participated in the planning and building of wireless data networks in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Italy, Lesotho, Malawi, Mexico, Morocco, Nicaragua, Peru, Trinidad, U.S.A. and Venezuela. He has presented in many conferences and published several papers related to wireless data communication and is coauthor and technical reviewer of the book “Wireless Networking for the Developing World” freely available from http://wndw.net/[http://wndw.net]. Ermanno holds a Master’s Degree from Stanford University and was Professor of Telecommunications at Universidad de los Andes in Venezuela from 1970 to 2000.
