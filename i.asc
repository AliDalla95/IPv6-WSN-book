He has more than 7 years and more than 20 projects of experience in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Internet of Things (IoT)
and applications and embedded firmware development; working in Zolertia as both senior R+D engineer and
CTO, buf if you ask him he just _"make things blink and chat"_.  In his free time he's normally
engaged in Coursera, collecting hardware platforms, dwelling in hackathons or preaching about GIT.

*Alvaro Vives* loves technology, problem solving, learning and teaching. Doing these things he has become a consultant, a network and systems engineer, and trainer.
