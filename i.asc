=== About the Authors

*Antonio Liñán* defines himself as _"an engineer at day, maker at night"_ (he would do both for free).
He has more than 7 years and more than 20 projects of experience in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Internet of Things (IoT)
applications and embedded firmware development; working in Zolertia as both senior R+D engineer and
CTO, buf if you ask him he just _"make things blink and chat"_.  In his free time he's normally
engaged in Coursera, collecting hardware platforms, dwelling in hackathons or preaching about GIT.
